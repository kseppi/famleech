# Introduction #

This simple python script's purpose is to scrape familysearch.org and get all of your ancestors information.


# Instructions for use #

The script is an extreem alpha, and likely has many bugs, but it seems to be working.

to run type: ./famleech 'url'

at the command prompt. The single quotes are essential.

Developed for linux, but I have run it on cygwin. It should work on a non cygwin windows install of python, but I have not tried that.
